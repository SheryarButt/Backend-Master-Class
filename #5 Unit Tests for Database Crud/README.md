# [Backend #5] Write Golang unit tests for database CRUD with random data

For unit tests, we'll be using Go's testing framework with **Testify**.

- Get Testify here:
  - `go get github.com/stretchr/testify'
- We'll be using *testify/require* to verify our tests.
- The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.
